# Interest Calculator

* Introduction An interest calculator is a tool that allows you to calculate the interest earned on an investment or the amount of interest due on a loan. It uses the formula for simple interest: I = Prt, where:

  P is the Principal amount of money to be invested.
  r is the Rate of Interest per year in decimal; r = R/100.
  t is the Time Periods involve.
 
* Simple Interest Calculation The simple interest accumulated on a principal of $10,000.00 at a rate of 3.875% per year for 5 years is $1,937.501. The calculation is as follows:

First, convert R percent to r a decimal: r = R/100 = 3.875%/100 = 0.03875 per year.
Then, solve the equation: I = 10000 × 0.03875 × 5 = 1937.5.

* Project Implementation You can implement this project in various programming languages. For example, there are several repositories on GitHub that provide implementations of an interest calculator. You can refer to these for inspiration.

* Extensions In addition to calculating simple interest, you can extend the project to calculate compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final investment value, n is the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t, and the other variables are as defined above.
